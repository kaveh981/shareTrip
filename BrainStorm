1- we need backend that gives us APIs 
2- we need a web application that public clients can have access to it and it consumes the back end API's
3- we can create a native app for public clients which consumes API's
4- we need a web application that only company employees can have access to it for managing data that consumes API's 
5- users can register with facebook, google or username password
6- user can create an event which has following properties:
-- from, to, when going, when coming back,name , requirments {ride, food, accomodation}, rules {noDrink, smoking, pets, underAge,...}
   capacity,...
7- users can search for events 
8- users can select interested event and they can see how many offers are left and based on the event requirment they can set what they want to provide 
   for that event
9- the creator of the event eaither can confirm interested people or reject them if it is not set to be as an instant booking
10- once the capacity of the event is full the event is being set as closed.
11- after the event is over the participant they can rate and leave reaview for each other once.

Searching Events:
 1- is there a ready service avaiable that can provide us with a list of avaiable events in every location how much is the cost of the service what details it returns and what details it requires.
 2- if the service isn't avaiable from which source we can get the events and register them into our inventory?
